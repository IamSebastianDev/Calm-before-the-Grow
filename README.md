# React Jam 2024 - Fall - Calm before the Bloom

**Calm before the Bloom** is designed to be a zen experience. There's no winning or losing ‚Äî just relax and enjoy the process of creating your own small island of tranquility.

## How to Play

At the start of each island, there is a **singular origin tile**. Clicking this tile will place the topmost tile from the **stack** on the left side of the screen. You can then place additional tiles around the one you've just positioned.

You automatically receive a new tile every **15 seconds**. You can also gain new tiles by **placing** tiles, **replacing** tiles with others, or by forming specific **patterns**‚Äîdiscovering these patterns is part of the fun.

In the upper right corner, a **Quest** will be displayed, offering hints and guiding you on what to do next. Completing these quests is optional, but doing so will help you progress and earn additional points.

## The Rest of the Talk

**Calm before the Bloom** was created for the [Reactjam Fall 2024](https://reactjam.com/) in 10 days. The theme was **Retro Minimalism**, and I aimed to capture the essence of minimalist games with a basic gameplay loop and progression system, all within a retro and minimalistic visual style. The game is best experienced on a desktop PC, though mobile may present some issues.

I implemented most of the features I intended, but I missed out on animated animals & trees, which were major features I couldn't complete. I apologize, but on the bright side, we adopted a cute puppy üê∂ that has been taking up a lot of time!
