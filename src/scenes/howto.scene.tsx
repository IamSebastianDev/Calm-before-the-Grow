                                minimalistic visual experience. The game is best enjoyed on a dekstop pc, mobile does

                                I was able to implement most of the features I wanted to, but missed out on animated
                                animals & trees, which were the two big features I was unable to complete. I'm sorry,
                                but we did adopt a cute puppy üê∂, which takes up quite some time.
